### User Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start">
    Developer Create an account and an organisation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a client (space)">
    Create a client space and add a client with an invite link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add specific content to client space">
    This step rely on features that must be sorted by priority for MVP, V1 etc...
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Features

Most important features rely on <Tooltip tip="Milestones are a core concept of that no-named SAAS">Milestones</Tooltip>.

Project can be split in 3 Milestones which are : `Conception/Prototyping`, `Development`, `Production`.

MVP must include one feature of each project milestone.
