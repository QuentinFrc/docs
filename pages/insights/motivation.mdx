## Context

> I'm a web developer, freelance and Founder of a web agency.

My goal with IT is to create beautiful and useful solutions for others.

It's important for me to create projects that are useful, fully optimized and that bring value to the users.
Including a nice UX and UI is also essential for me.

### SAAS

I'm interested in the SAAS world because it's a way to create a product that can be used by a lot of people.
The perfect opposite of an agency, you can create a product once and sell it multiple times. **More scalable, more profitable.**

In the context of a solo developer, it's also a way to create a business with a low budget, low risk, minimal investment (possibly).

## Saphyrr idea

### Startup context

With my last 3 years working in a startup that was also an agency.
Many problems exist in the agency world and the one that the company was trying to resolve, was the lack of multi-tenant project management tool.

<Accordion title="Company was looking for a tool where the agency can manage a client and freelancer at the same place.">
	The project was about creating a project management tool for our internal use.
	Abandonned when we realized that it didn't bring any value to the agency since internal
	tools are not something that you can sell. > Creating a tool for our internal workflow
	was not a good idea.
</Accordion>

### Own agency context

With my own agency, I've been looking for a tool that can help me manage my clients and offer them a space where they can see the creation of their project.
A good way to keep them informed and to have a better communication with them.
Also interested to have a space where can live useful informations for the clients even when project is done. (maintenance subscription, etc.)
